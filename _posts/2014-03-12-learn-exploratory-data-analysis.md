My friends [Moira](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./mkburke/), [Dean](http://deaneckles.com/), and [Solomon](http://solomonmessing.wordpress.com/) - all members of [Facebook’s Data Science team](http://facebook.com/data) - worked with Udacity to [create a fantastic course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651) on exploratory data analysis. If you’re new to R/ggplot, or just want to hear about how experts think about visualizing and exploring data, this would be a great place to start. I really can’t recommend these instructors highly enough.

They asked several members of our team to talk about an EDA project they worked on and these interviews are included in the course. You can check out me talking about [visualizing the sentiment from posts about NFL teams](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/the-emotional-highs-and-lows-of-the-nfl-season/10152033221418859) here. &nbsp;I talk about using splines versus more flexible models for time series data and the bias-variance tradeoff.
