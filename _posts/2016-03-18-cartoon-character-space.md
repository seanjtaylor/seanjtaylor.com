I had a ton of fun [crowdsourcing personality measurements](https://medium.com/@seanjtaylor/the-personality-space-of-cartoon-characters-e1d7b2009c15) of cartoon characters with [Shiu Pei Luu](https://www.instagram.com/meany_pie/). We were able to map the Big Five scale back to specific characters:

We also made a t-SNE embedding of the characters in 2D space:
