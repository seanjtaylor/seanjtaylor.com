# Hi!

I am a [data scientist](#data-science), [social scientist](#social-science), [statistician](#statistics), and [software developer](#software). I mostly specialize in methods for solving causal inference and business decision problems, and I am particularly interested in building tools for practitioners working on real-world problems. I'm a generalist, I like to hang out with people from many fields and borrow as many ideas as possible. I have collaborated with computer scientists, economists, political scientists, statisticians, machine learning researchers, and business school scholars. It's fun for me to jump around a bit, continue learning new things, and make connections between fields.

## <a name="statistics"> </a> Experimentation and Statistics

Here are some of my papers on experimentation and statistics. I'm relatively new to this field and mostly a consumer of statistics research, rather than a producer.

- [Variance-Weighted Estimators to Improve Sensitivity in Online Experiments](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3391403.3399542) (EC 2020) [(pdf)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1i9vxlslel3xt44/EC_2020.pdf?dl=0). You can watch [a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgIwougeN0M) by my co-author [Kevin Liou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinycliou/).
- [Randomized experiments to detect and estimate social influence in networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09636.pdf)  (Complex Spreading Phenomena in Social Systems). This is a book chapter with my friend [Dean Eckles](https://www.deaneckles.com/).
- [Active Matrix Factorization for Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07634) (Forthcoming in Annals of Applied Statistics)
- [Forecasting at Scale](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1380080?journalCode=utas20&) (The American Statistician) [(pdf)](http://lethalletham.com/ForecastingAtScale.pdf)



## <a name="software"> <a/> Forecasting Software

- [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is an open source forecasting package available in R and Python. You can watch [my talk about Prophet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOYAXv15r3A). You can also read my [explainer thread](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1123278380369973248).
